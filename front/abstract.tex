Despite the wide range of aplicability of machine learning techniques, the tools and methods 
available nowadays still require of expert knowledge to guide the decisions about the right machine
learning approach for a given problem. Such expert knowledge is rarely available and holds a degree
of subjectivity that makes it suboptimal for suggesting the machine learning strategy that best
adapts to a specific problem.

Since different machine learning techniques are suitable for different problems, choosing the right
technique and fine-tuning its particular settings are crucial tasks that will directly impact the
quality of the predictions obtained. However, deciding what machine learning setup is more
appropriate for processing specific data is not an easy task, as the number of choices is usually very
large and might even be infinite.

\vskip0.2cm
This work attempts to automate the choice of the most suitable machine learning algorithm and its
respective settings, in order to select the machine learning approach best suited to perform
predictions on a specific set of data, in a flexible and customizable way that enables the user to
specify their needs in terms of predictive power, sensitivity, specificity, consistency of the
predictions, and speed, among other criteria.

The results obtained show that using the machine learning technique and configuration suggested by
this automated approach yields predictions of a much higher quality than testing each technique
under its default settings. It is also shown that it is possible to guide the search for optimal
configurations of supervised machine learning algorithms by identifying ranges of values for each
possible setting that produce good results for most problems, and transferring such knowledge to new
problems, to quickly find optimal configurations of the algorithm under given data.
