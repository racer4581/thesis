		Nominal values are used for classification problems, in which each instance belongs to a
		class from a given set. Regression problems relate an instance to a vector of numerical
		values. For simplicity, $\class$ represents here such values, regardless of their
		cardinality (scalars or vectors) or type (nominal class or numerical value).
